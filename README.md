Our code is modified based on CLRNet, so many folder names remain unchanged; we will address these issues in future updates. We have uploaded the ResNet-101 and DLA-34 models trained on the CULane dataset. However, since there is a significant time gap between the upload and the experiments, if you encounter any problems, please raise them in the issues section, and we will resolve them promptly.
